**The Anirudh Protocol** is a premium, web-based workout tracking application designed to bridge the gap between safe biomechanics and aesthetic hypertrophy. Built with a "Safety First" philosophy, it guides users through specific workout splits (Push, Pull, Legs) with critical emphasis on tempo, form, and hydration.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Intelligent Workout Architecture**: Structured Push/Pull/Legs split with curated exercises.
-   **Critical Mechanics Engine**: Real-time emphasis on "1s Explosive UP / 3s Slow DOWN" tempo for maximum hypertrophy and safety.
-   **Interactive Guidance**: Detailed modal views for every exercise, offering specific cues and form tips.
-   **Hydration Integration**: Built-in reminders to ensure optimal hydration during sessions.
-   **Responsive & Aesthetic UI**: A "Dark Mode" inspired, high-contrast interface built with Tailwind CSS for focus and clarity.
-   **Type-Safe Foundation**: Fully typed with TypeScript for robust performance and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Core Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/) (v18)
-   **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For lightning-fast HMR and bundling.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> **"Gym Engine: Safe Mechanics / Aesthetic Hypertrophy"**

This project isn't just a list of exercises; it's a protocol.
-   **Tempo matters**: We enforce a specific cadence to maximize time under tension.
-   **Hydration matters**: Performance drops with dehydration. We track it.
-   **Form matters**: Detailed tips ensure you engage the target muscle, not just move weight.
